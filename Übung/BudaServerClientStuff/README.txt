This is a demo of some (very basic) client / server functionality.
Run BudaClient.java for the Client and BudaServer.java for the Server. Everything connects locally via port 8090

Type "Name:Jonas B." to change the client's name to Jonas B (the "." is where the name stops).

Type "Names" for the Server to display everyone who is connected along with their name (if they have set a name).

Typing "Quitx" should quit everything but I havent quite managed to implement that yet so just repeatedly use ctrl+c to quit everything.
