GENERAL INFORMATION: _______________________________________________________________________________________________

Protocol messages should always start with five characters (these are the Strings listed here).
If additional information is necessary, it should be given after a dollar sign, as such: PRTCL$information.
It should be noted that the server simply ignores the 6th character, however for clarity's sake it should always
be a $. If more than one piece of information needs to be sent, the separate pieces of information should also be
delimited with a dollar sign (see whisper for an example). In that case, it is very important that it is a $ and
nothing else. Also, in such cases, we need to make sure the pieces of information between the $ do not contain $
themselves (for example, usernames cannot contain $).

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The five-character Strings that define protocol messages are all defined as String variables in the Protocol.java
class. In this document, they are depicted as such:

nameOfStringVariable = "EXMPL"
EXMPL$information one$information two
    Documentation of Protocol message

So "EXMPL" is the actual protocol message being sent, however the code never implements this five-character String
directly but instead accesses it via Protocol.nameOfStringVariable, so the actual protocol message can be changed
later.

The second line, if present, shows an example of how the Syntax of the protocol message works, if the protocol
message is sent with additional arguments.

Indented is the actual documentation, which explains what the protocol message does.


BIDIRECTIONAL COMMANDS: ____________________________________________________________________________________________

pingBack = "PINGB"
    Ping-back message from client to server / server to client. To be sent upon receiving "CPING" / "SPING".
    The other party then registers this in its ClientPinger / ServerPinger thread.


CLIENT TO SERVER COMMANDS: _________________________________________________________________________________________

chatMsgToAll = "CHATA"
CHATA$Chat message
    When the server receives this, it broadcasts a chat message to all clients. The message has to be given in the
    protocol message after CHATA$, for example the protocol message CHATA$Hello everybody!, if sent from the user
    named Poirot, will print Poirot: Hello everybody! to every connected client's chat console (note the absence
    / presence of spaces).


chatMsgToLobby = "CHATL"
CHATL$Chat message
    When the server receives this, it broadcasts a chat message to all clients in the same Lobby. The message has to be
    given in the protocol message after CHATL$, for example the protocol message CHATL$Hello everybody!, if sent from
    the user named Poirot, will print Poirot: Hello everybody! to the chat console of every client in the lobby (note
    the absence / presence of spaces). If the client is not in a lobby, the chat message will be sent to everyone not
    in a lobby.


clientLogin = "LOGIN"
LOGIN$username
    The message sent by the client on login to set their name. For example, LOGIN$Poirot will use the
    clientHandler.setUsernameOnLogin() method to set this client's username to Poirot, and broadcast the announcement:
    "Poirot has joined the Server". Also, it will set this clientHandler's loggedIn boolean to true, which could be
    used later to refuse access to users who haven't formally logged in using this command.


nameChange = "NAMEC"
NAMEC$new name
    Client requests their name to be changed to whatever follows NAMEC$. For example, NAMEC$Poirot means the client
    wants to change their name to Poirot. However, the server will first pass this name through
    nameDuplicateChecker.checkName() to adjust it as needed (remove : and $ and add suffix in case of duplicate name.)


pingFromClient = "CPING"
    Client sends ping message to server. If the client doesn't recieve a pingback from the server, it shows a
    disconnection message and sets clientPinger.isConnected to false, which can be implemented somehow later.
    As soon as a pingback message is received, isConnected is set to true again and a reconnection message is printed.


clientQuitRequest = "QUITR"
    The client requests to quit. Once the server receives this message, it will send a serverConfirmQuit message to the
    client to confirm the quitting, then close the socket associated with that client and remove the clientHandler from
    the list of clientHandlers.


createNewLobby = "CRTLB"
    Client sends this message when they want to create a new lobby (& automatically join it). Client issues this
    command in ch.unibas.dmi.dbis.cs108.multiplayer.client.MessageFormatter using "/g". First a lobby Lobby is created
    of which the requesting client is the admin of.


listLobbies = "LISTL"
    Represents a clients' request for a list of lobbies, plus what players are in them.


listPlayersInLobby = "LISTP"
    Represents a clients' request for a list of all players within the lobby.


joinLobby = "JOINL"
JOINL$int
    Client requests to join the Lobby with the given number, for example,
    JOINL$2 means the client wants to join lobby 2.

leaveLobby = "LEAVL"
    Client requests to leave whatever lobby they're in.


whisper = "WHISP"
WHISP$recipient's username$message
    Whisper chat.


startANewGame = "STGAM"
    A Client (lobby admin) decides to start the game. The game is started in the lobby the message came from.
    Only one game can be started per lobby at a time.


listGames = "LISTG"
    Client request to see a list of all games, ongoing and finished.


votedFor = "CVOTE"
CVOTE$position$vote
    Client informs server that they have voted and delivers this vote in the form of "CVOTE$position$vote"


SERVER TO CLIENT COMMANDS: _________________________________________________________________________________________

pingFromServer = "SPING"
    Server sends ping message to client. If the server doesn't recieve a pingback from the client, it shows a
    disconnection message and sets serverPinger.isConnected to false, which can be implemented somehow later.
    As soon as a pingback message is received, isConnected is set to true again and a reconnection message is printed.


printToClientConsole = "CONSM"
CONSM$message
    prints out incoming announcements into the user's console. any string that follows CONSM$ is printed as is, so the
    message that follows already has to be formatted the way it should be shown to the client.


printToClientChat = "CHATM"
CHATM$message
    prints out incoming chat messages into the user's chat. any string that follows CHATM$ is printed as is, so the
    message that follows already has to be formatted the way it should be shown to the client.


serverConfirmQuit = "QUITC"
    Server confirms the client's quit request, meaning that the client can now close its sockets and quit.


serverRequestsGhostVote = "GVOTR"
GVOTR$passenger position (int)$train information
    The server requests the client (who should be a ghost) to vote on the victim. in the format
    GVOTR$string the current train will be shown as a string to the client


serverRequestsHumanVote = "HVOTR"
HVOTR$passenger position (int)$train information
    The server requests the client (who should be a human) to vote on who is a ghost / who should be kicked
    off the train.


changedUserName = "CHNAM"
CHNAM$newname
    Informs Client that their username has been changed.
