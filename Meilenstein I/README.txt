Regarding the "Name of the Game" achievement:

Our game is called "Night Train to Budapest" and we are "the Conductors"

Regarding the "Ahead of Schedule and Under Budget!" achievement:

Apart from the mockup in our presentation, we have already produced some code for client/server functionality including sending short messages from client to server, multiple clients connecting on different threads, and clients changing their nickname, as well as the server displaying a list of who is connected and what their nicknames and numbers are.

This can be found in the following directory:
