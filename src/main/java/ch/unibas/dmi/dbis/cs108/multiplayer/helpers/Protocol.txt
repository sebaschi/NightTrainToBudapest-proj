Client commands:

Implemented:
 * CHATA$message      Send chat message to all
 * QUITS              request to quit server/ leave server. The server should then remove the
                      relevant ClientHandler and close the sockets, but before doing so, it sends
                      "QUITC" to the client to confirm the quitting. The client doesn't close any
                      sockets until receiving "QUITC"
 * CPING              Ping from client to server.
 * PINGB              Pingback from client to server.
 * NAMEC$name         Change name to whatever is specified

Future / planned:
 * CRTGM              Create a new game
 * CHATW              whisper chat
 * CHATG              ghost chat
 * LEAVG              leave a game
