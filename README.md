# Night Train to Budapest

## Overview

In this game you find yourself under five others on a night train to Budapest. One of you is the ghost which haunts the train every night turning one innocent human into a fellow ghost.

If you are playing as a human your task is it to find the menacing creature that is turning everybody so you can safely reach your destiny in human form.

If you are playing as a ghost you aim to turn all humans into your peers and hide the original ghost's identity.

Votes are held in the night for the ghosts to decide who will be next and during the day for the humans to decide who they think the ghost is.
